    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features, and it does so in a way that is distinct from other regression methods. Multicollinearity refers to the situation where two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, making it difficult to distinguish their individual effects on the dependent variable. Here's how Lasso addresses this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Multicollinearity with Lasso Regression:\n",
    "Regularization: The core mechanism through which Lasso handles multicollinearity is its L1 regularization term. This term penalizes the absolute size of the regression coefficients, and as a result, Lasso tends to shrink some of these coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Due to the L1 penalty, Lasso can effectively perform feature selection. In the presence of multicollinearity, Lasso may select one of the correlated predictors and shrink the coefficients of others towards zero. This can be particularly useful when dealing with datasets with a large number of features, some of which are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing Overfitting: Multicollinearity can lead to overfitting in regression models, where the model becomes overly sensitive to the specific noise in the training data. By shrinking coefficients, Lasso helps in reducing the model's variance, thus mitigating overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations:\n",
    "Arbitrary Selection: In cases of high multicollinearity, Lasso may arbitrarily choose one feature over another among the correlated ones. This selection might not always be consistent across different samples of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: It is generally a good practice to standardize the predictors before applying Lasso, especially in the presence of multicollinearity. This ensures that the regularization is applied uniformly across all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: While Lasso can handle multicollinearity and help in feature selection, it can make the interpretation of model coefficients more challenging, especially in determining the effect of each individual variable when they are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "Strong Multicollinearity: In cases of extremely strong multicollinearity, Lasso might struggle, as the algorithm's ability to differentiate between correlated predictors diminishes. In such cases, other techniques or models might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Tuning: The effectiveness of Lasso in handling multicollinearity is influenced by the choice of the regularization parameter (lambda, λ). Choosing an optimal λ is crucial, as it determines the extent of shrinkage and feature selection."
