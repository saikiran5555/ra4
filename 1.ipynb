    "Lasso Regression, which stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization component. The key characteristics of Lasso Regression and how it differs from other regression techniques are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Lasso Regression:\n",
    "Regularization Term: Lasso Regression adds a regularization term to the standard linear regression's loss function. This term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda, λ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficient Shrinkage: The regularization term in Lasso Regression causes the coefficients of the model to shrink towards zero. The strength of this shrinkage is controlled by λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: One of the unique properties of Lasso Regression is its ability to perform feature selection. Coefficients of less important features can become exactly zero, effectively removing them from the model. This is particularly useful in models with a large number of features, some of which might be irrelevant or redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from Other Regression Techniques:\n",
    "Compared to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS focuses on minimizing the sum of squared residuals and does not include a regularization term. As a result, it does not have the feature selection capability and can suffer from overfitting, especially in the presence of multicollinearity or when dealing with high-dimensional data.\n",
    "Lasso, by contrast, can yield a more generalizable model and helps in reducing overfitting through its regularization term.\n",
    "Compared to Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression also introduces a regularization term, but it uses the sum of the squares of the coefficients (L2 regularization) instead of their absolute values (L1 regularization as used in Lasso).\n",
    "While Ridge Regression shrinks coefficients, it does not set them to zero. Therefore, it does not have the feature selection property of Lasso.\n",
    "Compared to Elastic Net:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net is a hybrid of Lasso and Ridge Regression. It includes both L1 (absolute value) and L2 (square value) regularization terms.\n",
    "Elastic Net can be more robust in situations where there are highly correlated features or when the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations, as it combines the benefits of both Lasso and Ridge.\n",
    "Applications and Limitations:\n",
    "Applications: Lasso is particularly useful when you suspect that only a subset of your features are important, or when you have a large number of features and you want to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "Limitations: The choice of λ is critical in Lasso; too high a value can lead to underfitting. Also, Lasso might struggle in situations where there are groups of highly correlated variables, as it tends to arbitrarily select one feature from a group and ignore the others."
