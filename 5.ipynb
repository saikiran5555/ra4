    "Lasso Regression is primarily a linear model, meaning it is designed for linear relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable. However, it can be adapted to address non-linear relationships in a few ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Transformation:\n",
    "One common method to apply Lasso Regression to non-linear problems is through feature transformation. This involves transforming or creating new features that capture the non-linear relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Features: You can create polynomial features (e.g., squared, cubic terms) from the original features. For instance, if you have a feature \n",
    "�\n",
    "X, you can include \n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    ",\n",
    "�\n",
    "3\n",
    "X \n",
    "2\n",
    " ,X \n",
    "3\n",
    " , etc., as new features in the model.\n",
    "Interaction Terms: Including interaction terms (e.g., \n",
    "�\n",
    "1\n",
    "×\n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    "X \n",
    "1\n",
    "​\n",
    " ×X \n",
    "2\n",
    "​\n",
    " ) can help in capturing the interactions between different features which might be non-linear.\n",
    "Other Non-linear Transformations: Applying non-linear functions such as logarithmic, exponential, or trigonometric transformations to features can also help in modeling non-linear relationships.\n",
    "After transforming the features, you can apply Lasso Regression to this expanded feature set. Lasso's ability to perform feature selection becomes particularly useful here, as it can help in identifying the most relevant transformed features and potentially eliminate those that don't contribute much to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Kernel Methods:\n",
    "Another approach, although less common with Lasso, involves using kernel methods. This is more typically seen in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) but can be adapted for Lasso. Kernel methods map the features into a higher-dimensional space where the relationship between the features and the target variable may be linear. However, implementing kernel methods with Lasso is not straightforward and requires more advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Piecewise-Linear Models:\n",
    "Lasso can be used as part of a piecewise-linear modeling approach, where the data is divided into segments, and a linear model is fit to each segment. This approach can approximate a non-linear relationship through multiple linear segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations and Limitations:\n",
    "Model Complexity: When adding polynomial or interaction terms, the number of features can grow quickly, increasing the model complexity. Lasso helps in mitigating this by performing feature selection.\n",
    "Interpretability: While feature transformations allow Lasso to model non-linear relationships, they can make the interpretation of the model more complex.\n",
    "Performance: The effectiveness of Lasso in capturing non-linear relationships depends on how well the transformed features represent these relationships. It may not perform as well as models inherently designed for non-linear data, like decision trees or neural networks."
