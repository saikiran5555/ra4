    "Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are both methods of regularization, which are used to prevent overfitting in regression models by adding a penalty to the loss function. However, they differ in the type of penalty imposed and, as a result, have different characteristics and effects on the regression model. Here's a detailed comparison:\n",

    "1. Type of Regularization Penalty:\n",
    "Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):\n",
    "\n",
    "Applies a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",
    "The regularization term is the sum of the squared coefficients multiplied by the regularization parameter (\n",

    "2. Feature Selection:\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Does not inherently perform feature selection.\n",
    "It will shrink the coefficients of less important features but does not set any coefficients to zero.\n",
    "Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can inherently perform feature selection due to the nature of the L1 penalty.\n",
    "It can shrink coefficients of less important features all the way to zero, effectively removing them from the model.\n",
    "3. Behavior with Highly Correlated Features:\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tends to distribute the coefficient weight among the correlated features.\n",
    "It does not favor one over another, which can be advantageous when the correlated variables are equally important.\n",
    "Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "May arbitrarily select one feature among the correlated ones and shrink others to zero.\n",
    "This can be a limitation in scenarios where all correlated features are important.\n",
    "4. Solution Path:\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution path (change in coefficients with change in \n",
    "�\n",
    "λ) is smooth.\n",
    "This can be advantageous in terms of stability and predictability.\n",
    "Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution path can be more erratic, particularly as coefficients enter and leave the model (go to zero).\n",
    "5. Model Interpretability:\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Less interpretable in scenarios with a large number of features, as it includes all features in the final model.\n",
    "Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "More interpretable due to feature selection, as it provides a simpler model with fewer features.\n",
    "6. Performance:\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Often preferred when most features have a significant effect on the output and when the number of predictors is greater than the number of observations.\n",
    "Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferred when the goal is to identify a subset of predictors with the strongest effects, or when dealing with high-dimensional data where feature selection is crucial."
